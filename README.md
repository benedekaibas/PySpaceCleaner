## üìô About the Code

PySpaceCleaner is a Python-based tool designed to efficiently remove all whitespaces from a given file. With PySpaceCleaner, users can automate the process of whitespace removal, saving time and effort compared to manually editing files line by line. This tool is particularly useful for cleaning up text files, code files, or other plain-text documents where whitespace can affect formatting or data processing.

## ‚ùì How to run the code?

PySpaceCleaner supports a simple and intuitive command-line interface, allowing users to specify the file they wish to process. Once executed, the tool reads the file, removes all extraneous whitespace (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks), and overwrites the file with the cleaned content. This ensures that the output is concise and free from unnecessary characters, making it ideal for tasks such as preparing data for analysis, optimizing code readability, or adhering to strict formatting guidelines.
